# FingerprintControls
A simple project I made to allow for android navigation using the fingerprint scanner. This application is made specifically with the goal of removing the navigation bar from the bottom completely. Several unique features are added to help accomplish this goal, such as dynamically changing the functions of fingerprint swipes based on the current state of the phone (i.e. what application is in the forground, whether the "Recent Apps" view is present, etc).

## Feature List
- Custom actions on fingerprint swipe
- Unique custom actions on fingerprint swipe while in the "Recent Apps" view
- (Coming Soon) Unique custom actions while in specific apps
- (Coming Soon) Disable fingerprint actions via notification
